      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi everyone! My name is Allysha (Uh-lee-sha, "Alicia"). I'll be 30 this August. I live downtown with my husband and two cats Stella and Kirby. 
        I am currently a registered nurse working in the operating room. I am interested in architecture, design, fashion, art, science. Besides an introduction to Java course that I have completed, I don't have much coding experience. 
        I am nervous, but very excited to start this new journey!
      </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was raised up north near Canada in Bellingham, WA</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>In my free time you can usually find me watching anime (currently: Samurai Champloo and Attack on Titan) or playing video games. 
        I've recently downloaded Procreate on my iPad to learn and create digital art. I've always loved art and am wanting to tap back into my more creative side. </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I'm uncertain what type of job is my "dream job," but I would love to work in a space that is creative and collaborative where I can grow as a developer. </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Seattle, WA</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Over the past year I have been desiring a change. I felt as if I was questioning everything (I refer to it as my "crisis" period) and wondering if my current line of work was truly what I wanted/was meant to do . 
        I want to be able to get into a more creative field where I can utilize both front-end and back-end skill set. So, here I am! ^_^
